So you will need to first plug the cyd in your computer [IT DOSENT MATTER IF IT HAS 1 USB C 1 USB MICRO] it will work
next step You need to download the esptool.zip from the relases 
second step Unzip the folder And go in the folder open a cmd and now you will flash it with this command esptool write_flash 0x0 esp32-2432s028r-st7789_full_4MB_v0.7.0-rc12_dada059.bin
if you have any problem with flashing contact me on discord :awp13
next you will get a working screen or a not working screen if your screen is black i dont know how to help you but if your screen is half working backwards
then you will need to connect to the cyd on wifi it will have a network name like this Openhasp_XXXXXX
heres the password for the wifi : haspadmin
and if your connected you will get prompet with a wifi page here you will need to set your wifi name and password if correct it shloud connect 
if its connected you will need to type this ip addres into your browser : 192.168.0.240
it will open the openhasp page next go to configuration display settings and choose 0 degrees and next type this into your browser http://192.168.0.240/reboot
this will reboot the cyd and if everything done correctly you're finished have fun !
